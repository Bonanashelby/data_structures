##Linked List Branch
#Implement a push(val), pop(), size(), search(val), remove(node), display(), len(the_list), print(the_list) function for this exercise. 
#Worked on creating a single linked list.
#Used all these methods for our single linked list in linked_list.py
#([1, 2, 3]) => (3) -> (2) -> (1)

##Stack Branch 
#Implement a push(val) and pop() functions for this exercise.
#Used the push and pop methods from the Linked List. 


##DLL Branch
#Implement the push(val), append(val), pop(), shift(), remove(val) and len() functions for this exercise.
#Worked on making our nodes point to each other in the double link list format.
#Where (none) <- (1) -> (2) -> (3) -> (none) and
#Where (none) <- (1) <- (2) <- (3) -> (none) and
#Where (1) is the head and (3) is the tail in this instance.


##Queue Branch 
#Implement a enqueue(), dequeue(), peek(), size() function for this exercise. 
#Worked on enqueue and dequeue with our double linked list methods.
#Used the shift and pop methods from our double linked list in dll.py.
